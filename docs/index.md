# Appwrite ORM

A TypeScript ORM for Appwrite.
This is based on the packages 'appwrite' and 'appwrite-node'. This package has both a client side and server side features.

This is a documentation (made mostly VIA AI, and a bit by me) on usage, development, and general guides for everything.

Also, THIS PACKAGE IS STILL INCOMPLETE! I am constantly adding new features and fixing bugs. If you encounter a bug or want to add a feature, I'd be happy to implement it. Just write something in the discussion on github
